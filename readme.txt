Data Asset for week 4 ! Enjoy.

Fully functional. 

Test your program on the file athens_keyflute.txt . Notice that the correct key “flute” {5, 11, 20,
19, 4} is detected for English, French, Danish, German, and Dutch, due to ‘e’ being the most
common character and the languages having cognates, but English has the greatest number of
valid words for its decryption.
